# Yaz0 Library

A small library for compressing and decompressing data using Nintendo's Yaz0 algorithm.
There are simple driver programs for compressing and decompressing a file, but one of them doesn't work (presumably the code in the library, not the driver), I think it's the decompressor, but I need to look further into it when I get time.
